# DIP-Task-5
Task 05
A Python program performs basic image processing on a color image using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It shows the original image, separates the red, green, and blue channels, converts the image to grayscale, and creates a binary image using thresholding. The program then finds connected components to detect and count objects, and displays both the binary image and the labeled result.
